TensorFlow is a tensor, it is a multi-dimensional array. In TensorFlow, all calculations deal with tensors. TensorFlow itself is nothing more than a symbolic mathematics library. It allows you to describe with great conciseness difficult mathematical computations, which will make your computation faster and more efficient.
Keras is a Python API for neural networks, user-friendly, and high-level, built on top of TensorFlow and other backends, including Theano. It is designed to enable fast prototyping. Most of the complications in TensorFlow are abstracted out, making it useful not only for beginners but also for experts. Keras places a very high value on simplicity and readability, which makes it very easy to experiment with different models or architectures and compare results.
Keras uses TensorFlow as the back-end, providing the computational engine, with Keras as the interface by which you build and train your models. You will leverage the performance optimizations offered by TensorFlow as well, so you
